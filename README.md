#Overvies
This challenge was designed to retrieve temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. This data will be used to determine if the surf and ice cream shop would be a feasible for year round business.

#Analysis
1.June is a slightly warmer month than December as the maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees versus 83 degrees in December.
2.It appears that December has significantly cooler temperatures with the minimum temperature being 56 degrees compared with 64 degrees in June.
3.The data also identified that the average temperature in June(74 degrees) is only 3 degrees warmer than the average temperature in December(71 degrees), this alone would indicate that the business should be sustainable throughout the year. 

#Summary
The results of this query indicates that June and December have similar weather temperatures.  I think it would be valid to compare precipitation between the two months and also study the number of visitors throughout the year to determine if the population could sustain the store as well.
